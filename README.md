Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For 
this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point - 
[Keys to a well written README](https://tinyurl.com/yk3wubft).

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you decide what to include
in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.

- [Technologies Used](#technologies-used)

## Features

- Search meteorites: Search and filter by name, year of landing, composition type and mass.
- Statistics: Histograms classifying the resulting meteorites by year and composition; number and average mass of resulting meteorites.
- Map of meteorites: The resulting meteorites are displayed on a world map and when a row in the table of results is clicked on, the corresponding pop up is opened on the map.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Fireball application locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v45-tier1-team-11.git
   ```

2. Use your usual method to start a server (Python or Node.js HTTP Server, Live Server from VSCode...) and access the corresponding port.

## Usage

Fireball provides functionality to analyse data of meteorites. Here are some common actions users can perform:

- **Filter**: Select a parameter to filter the meteorites by, consecutive filters can be applied. All filters can be cleared afterwards.
- **Browse on map**: Zoom, move and click on markers to find meteorites and read their coordinates.
- **Find location on map**: Click on a meteorite row to open the corresponding pop-up on the map.
- **Statistics**: Understand the data visually by histograms of year of landing and meteorite composition.

## Technologies Used

Fireball is meant to be a front end web application and it is built in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
